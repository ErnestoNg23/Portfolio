Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub page, made as a way of showcasing some of the work I've done as part of the NESC3505 Neural Data Science class with Dalhousie University's Department of Psychology & Neuroscience. I'm Ernest, a 3rd year Neuroscience major. I do a lot of research into motor skills and motor learning, including setting up and running studies. Most of that requires extensive coding knowledge and while I had 0 prior knowledge about coding, here I am anyway. Python can seem scary to a beginner (frankly, it still scares me too. I might dress up as a Python error code next Halloween) but this portfolio serves as an example of some of the things that can be accomplished through Python, even with a beginner like myself 

### Code demonstrations & examples
Below are just some of the examples of codes I have written throughout my time in this class, ranging from super simple 1st day of Python bootcamp stuff to much more complicated arrays and plots. 

## Heat Map generation using Python
Here is some code I wrote on [how to generate Heat Map plots](Heat Map stuff.md)
